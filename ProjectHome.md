RacerTC project aim is to develop feature-rich 2D racing game for Android platform. Our team's goal is to provide ultimate racing experiance, with realistic driving model, fine 2D graphics, and so on. Currently we are working on single-player mode only, altough multiplayer is in future plans.

The project is open, so if you feel you could help - don't hesitate to contact us!

Please note, that project development has moved to github (up-to-date, WIP code is available under http://github.com/racerTC/racerTC/). Nevertheless, GC SVN repository will be updated with each major release of the game, so you can download latest stable code from here!
